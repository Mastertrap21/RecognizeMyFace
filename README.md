# RecognizeMyFace
Simple program with minimal GUI showcasing the power of OpenCV library for computer vision.

It can detect faces in images and video streams. It will check if the detected faces are recognized (match previous seen faces).

Cropped unique faces will be saved on the disk for each media stream.

Written in Visual C++ for easy UI and unmanaged C++ for OpenCV processing.
